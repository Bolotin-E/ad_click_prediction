<h3>Data Sources</h3>
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "ad_click_dataset.csv" file. 

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

This dataset provides insights into user behavior and online advertising, specifically focusing on predicting whether a user will click on an online advertisement. It contains user demographic information, browsing habits, and details related to the display of the advertisement. This dataset is ideal for building binary classification models to predict user interactions with online ads.

<h3>Features</h3>

<b>id:</b> Unique identifier for each user.

<b>full_name:</b> User's name formatted as "UserX" for anonymity.

<b>age:</b> Age of the user (ranging from 18 to 64 years).

<b>gender:</b> The gender of the user (categorized as Male, Female, or Non-Binary).

<b>device_type:</b> The type of device used by the user when viewing the ad (Mobile, Desktop, Tablet).

<b>ad_position:</b> The position of the ad on the webpage (Top, Side, Bottom).

<b>browsing_history:</b> The user's browsing activity prior to seeing the ad (Shopping, News, Entertainment, Education, Social Media).

<b>time_of_day:</b> The time when the user viewed the ad (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).

<b>click:</b> The target label indicating whether the user clicked on the ad (1 for a click, 0 for no click).

<h3>Goal</h3>

The objective of this dataset is to predict whether a user will click on an online ad based on their demographics, browsing behavior, the context of the ad's display, and the time of day. 
You will need to clean the data, understand it and then apply machine learning models to predict and evaluate data. It is a really challenging request for this kind of data. This data can be used to improve ad targeting strategies, optimize ad placement, and better understand user interaction with online advertisements.

<h3>Tools</h3>

- Python (Jupyter Notebook) - Developed a program that performs data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and applies machine learning models to generate predictions
- Power BI - Creating reports
